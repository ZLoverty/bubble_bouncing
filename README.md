# bubble_bouncing

Simulation code for the bubble bouncing project. The basic model uses the thin film equation and a force balance model to simulate the shape and motion of a bubble when bouncing into a solid surface (as in Manica 2015, Esmaili 2019 and Hooshanginejad 2023). 

On top of existing works, the current simulation code features:

1. Oseen wake induced circulation, which leads to a lift force;
2. Object oriented programming with improved readability and maintainability;
3. Data saveing with high performance .h5 files;
4. Visualization tools.
